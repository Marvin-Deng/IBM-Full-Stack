# Budgeting Allocation App

This is the final project for IBM's Developing Front End Apps with React course. This project emphasizes the use of Redux for effective state management, allowing users to seamlessly track their expenses and manage their budgets. Users can easily add, edit, and delete expenses to keep a detailed record of spending and set monthly budgets for different categories and monitor expenses against budgets.
